##utils

The utils package contains a collection of various helper classes. We're not sure if all of this classes or really necessary, but we need to use them for now. 

###This classes help to:
* create new instances of an object (e.g. [FeatureUtils](https://github.com/MICommunity/psi-jami/blob/develop/jami-core/src/main/java/psidev/psi/mi/jami/utils/FeatureUtils.java#L20))
* parse, validate, extract (e.g. [RangeUtils.java](https://github.com/MICommunity/psi-jami/blob/develop/jami-core/src/main/java/psidev/psi/mi/jami/utils/RangeUtils.java))
* generating checksums (e.g.[Checksum package](https://github.com/MICommunity/psi-jami/tree/develop/jami-core/src/main/java/psidev/psi/mi/jami/utils/checksum))
* deal with collections (e.g. [Collection package](https://github.com/MICommunity/psi-jami/tree/develop/jami-core/src/main/java/psidev/psi/mi/jami/utils/collection))
* compare jami objects (e.g. [Comparator package](https://github.com/MICommunity/psi-jami/tree/develop/jami-core/src/main/java/psidev/psi/mi/jami/utils/comparator))
* clone jami objects (e.g. [Clone package](https://github.com/MICommunity/psi-jami/tree/develop/jami-core/src/main/java/psidev/psi/mi/jami/utils/clone))
